# hello-world
This is my first Repository

Hey yall!  I am pretty just starting out on this new journey!  I have experiance with using website builders, and some coding knowladge from things I have seen online, taken classes in, and have learned by doing.  

I am looking to take the next step of my career, and I figured this might be one of the best things I could do for myself.  

I am getting married in October, so starting a family means I need to improve myself for our future!
